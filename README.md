# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION

This project builds a predictive model to forecast customer churn for a subscription-based service. Leveraging historical data, including usage behavior and demographics, it identifies customers at risk of leaving. The project explores algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to achieve accurate churn predictions.


# Project Overview:.
Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to both consumers and financial institutions, making it critical to accurately detect fraudulent transactions. This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to classify credit card transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate. By experimenting with various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, the goal is to create a reliable model that can be effectively implemented in real-world applications.

# In this project:.
