# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to forecast customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. By leveraging historical customer data, including features such as usage behavior and customer demographics, the model aims to identify customers at risk of leaving the service. The project explores various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, to build an accurate and reliable churn prediction model.
